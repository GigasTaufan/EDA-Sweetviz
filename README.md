# EDA With Sweetviz

More information about [Sweetviz](https://pypi.org/project/sweetviz/)

Sweetvis is a library that can help to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) in Python quickly. In this repo I use Iris dataset and use Sweetviz to analyze single dataset
and also analyze Train and Test data.
